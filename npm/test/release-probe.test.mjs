// The release probe's third answer: NOT ANSWERED.
//
// `scripts/release-probe.sh` answers a registry-qualified identifier in exactly
// three ways — a version on stdout, nothing on stdout, or a non-zero exit with
// its reason on stderr. The first two need a public registry to answer, so they
// are proven against the real registries by `npm/test/live/release-probe.test.mjs`
// under `just release-probe-check`, which sits outside `just check` for the
// reason `just deps-check` does: the deterministic gate stays offline.
//
// What is left is the answer that must never be confused with the second one,
// and every route to it is reachable with no network at all. A consumer holds
// indefinitely on "not answered" and must never read it as evidence that nothing
// is published, so each case below asserts all three of: a non-zero exit, an
// empty stdout, and a reason with a next action on stderr.
