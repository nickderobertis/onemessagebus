// How this repository's own tiers *read* `release-targets.toml`: as a consumer
// with a standard TOML parser and no knowledge of this repository reads it.
//
// Reading is all this does. Whether the document conforms to the canonical
// release-target schema is decided by that schema's own implementation —
// `onevcs`'s reader, called from `crates/onemessagebus-e2e/tests/release_declaration.rs` — and never by
// anything here: a schema restated in the repository that writes against it is a
// second opinion presented as the first one, and the copy is what drifts. So there
// is no validation below, and a document that is wrong is wrong at that gate.
//
// What a caller gets back is the identifier split the way the schema spells it,
// `<registry>:<name>`, because both callers ask a registry a question about a name.
//
// Shared by the drift tier (`npm/test/release-targets.test.mjs`, which holds this
// list against what a release really publishes) and the live probe tier
// (`npm/test/live/release-probe.test.mjs`, which asks each registry about it).
