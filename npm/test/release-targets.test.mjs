// The drift gate for what this repository declares it releases.
//
// `release-targets.toml` names one registry-qualified identifier per
// **consumable** artifact — one a dependent names in order to depend on it — so
// an orchestrator that landed a fix here can hold until the artifact carrying it
// is downloadable. A declaration that has gone stale is worse than none: a
// consumer waits on the target it was told about while the artifact it actually
// consumes ships unwatched. That is the failure this file exists to make loud.
//
// So nothing here is transcribed. The published set is derived from the release
// configuration itself:
//
//   * which registries publish at all — the `publish-*` jobs in
//     `.github/workflows/release.yml`,
//   * the crate names — every workspace member Cargo will publish, read from
//     `cargo metadata` (a `publish = false` member such as the CLI crate is
//     not a target: nothing depends on it by name),
//   * the PyPI project name — `pyproject.toml`'s `[project]`,
//   * the npm launcher name — `npm/onemessagebus-cli/package.json`, and the
//     per-platform package names — `scripts/npm-build.mjs`'s TARGETS, through
//     the same template that script names them by.
//
// Add an artifact anywhere in that configuration and this fails until
// `release-targets.toml` accounts for it; declare one this repository does not
// publish and it fails the other way.
//
// What that document may SAY is a separate question from whether it is true, and
// it is answered separately: `crates/onemessagebus-e2e/tests/release_declaration.rs` hands it to the
// canonical schema's own reader — `onevcs`'s, the one implementation that defines
// it — and this repository restates none of those rules. So the document read
// below is one that has already been held to its schema, and everything here is
// about drift alone. It is read the way a consumer with a standard TOML parser and
// no knowledge of this repository reads it.
//
// A gate that only ever runs against a tree it passes proves nothing about what it
// would catch, so the last two cases run these same checks over a checkout of this
// repository's real release configuration whose declaration has been changed in one
// direction and then the other — a name published without being declared, and a
// name declared without being published. Nothing is stubbed: every input is the
// real file, and exactly one of them differs.
//
// A release also attaches per-target archives to the GitHub Release, and those
// are not targets: nothing *depends* on one — they are for manual download, and
// the three registries are the documented install surfaces — so no dependent can
// be waiting on one. Only the `publish-*` jobs reach a registry, which is why
// they are what this reads.
//
// The per-platform packages are covered rather than declared: nothing names one
// in order to depend on it — npm resolves it for the launcher, at the launcher's
// own exact version — so the launcher is the target and they are the identifiers
// it `covers`. `platform-matrix.test.mjs` holds the launcher's
// `optionalDependencies` to the release matrix; this file holds the declaration's
// `covers` to what a release actually publishes.
