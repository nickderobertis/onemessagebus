//! What this repository publishes, held to the schema that defines it.
//!
//! `release-targets.toml` at this root is written against the canonical
//! release-target schema — the one `onevcs`'s `docs/contract.md` defines and every
//! repository in this stack writes against. That schema has exactly one
//! implementation, `onevcs`'s own reader, and this suite *is* that reader:
//! [`onevcs::validate_release_declaration`] is what a consumer reading this
//! repository's declaration runs, so what passes here is what passes there.
//!
//! Deliberately not a copy of those rules. A schema restated in each repository
//! that writes against it is the duplication the shared format exists to remove:
//! the copies drift, and a document that passes the copy is still refused by the
//! tool that actually reads it. Nothing below decides what the schema says — every
//! refusal here is the reader's, quoted back.
//!
//! And the refusals are most of the value. A declaration is written once and then
//! read by machinery with no way to fix it, so what this gate is worth is what it
//! REFUSES. Each case below refuses a document built by taking this repository's
//! real one and changing exactly one thing about it, so every refusal is of a
//! document somebody could plausibly have written.
//!
//! Whether what the document says is *true* — whether a release really publishes
//! what it declares — is a different question with a different gate:
//! `npm/test/release-targets.test.mjs` holds it against the release configuration
//! itself, in both directions.
//!
//! This lives in `onemessagebus-repo` rather than a published crate because `onevcs`
//! is banned everywhere else in the workspace: the bus is a leaf the stack
//! adopts, and this crate is the one wrapper `deny.toml` lets name it.
