//! The agent note contract: a role-addressed correction delivered into a running
//! two-party conversation, as the first message family over the core's inbox.
//!
//! These shapes moved here unchanged from their original producer —
//! the same names, the same serde shapes and the same refusals — so that
//! every stack consumer re-exports one declaration instead of
//! each carrying the seam. The golden fixture holds the original bytes and
//! refusal words.
//!
//! * A [`Note`] is a [`Message`] (`agent.note@1`): who it is for ([`Addressee`]), what
//!   the addressee reads ([`NoteText`]), and the property it binds, if any
//!   ([`Criterion`]).
//! * [`Accepted`] is the [`Disposition`] a conversation answers a note with, and
//!   [`Carried`]: a note carried to a conversation that is not running is queued
//!   for its next turn.
//! * [`Notes`] and [`NoteInbox`] are the core's [`Sender`] and [`Inbox`] over the
//!   two, so a note reaches a live conversation in process, through a spool from
//!   another process, or carried to a later one by the same mechanism.
//!
//! What a conversation *does* with a delivered note — reopen the worker's turn,
//! re-take the supervisor's decision — is the conversation's, and stays in
//! its original producer. So does routing: the inbox promises only that a note reaches
//! [`Inbox::take`] or its sender learns why not.
//!
//! # Where this departs from the original module
//!
//! [`Notes::send`] is the core's `Sender::send`, so it answers the core's
//! [`InboxUndelivered`] rather than this module's [`Undelivered`];
//! `Undelivered: From<InboxUndelivered>` reads a note refusal carried in a close
//! back into the variant it was, so a caller keeps its old error with one
//! `.map_err(Into::into)`. [`NoteInbox`]'s `delivered()` is [`NoteInboxExt`]'s,
//! re-exported by [`prelude`], because a crate cannot add a method to the core's
//! type. [`worker_block`] is public, where the original module kept it private.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! use onemessagebus_agent::note::prelude::*;
//! use onemessagebus_agent::note::{Accepted, Addressee, Note, Notes, Party};
//!
//! let (notes, inbox) = Notes::channel();
//! let sending = std::thread::spawn(move || {
//!     notes.send(Note::to(Addressee::Worker, "the reviewer asked for a smaller diff"))
//! });
//!
//! let delivered = inbox.take_within(Duration::from_secs(10)).expect("the note arrives");
//! assert_eq!(delivered.message().addressee, Addressee::Worker);
//! delivered.answer(Accepted::Interrupted { party: Party::Worker });
//!
//! assert_eq!(sending.join().unwrap(), Ok(Accepted::Interrupted { party: Party::Worker }));
//! assert_eq!(inbox.delivered()[0].delivered_to, Party::Worker);
